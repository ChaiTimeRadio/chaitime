								<h2>Nritya Yoga - Combining The Ancient Art of Bharatanatyam and Yoga: In conversation with Dr. Swati Daithankar and Smt. Vasanthi Bhat</h2>
								<p>We are living in a world in which either we are striving for something which we donâ€™t have or destroying what we have in order to gain something else. But in the end, we realize that we all are looking for shaanti or peace. Somehow, most of us look outside to seek this fulfillment.  I believe that the combination of art and exercise  and relating to the world through dance, music, pranayam, exercise, one can attain what he or she is striving for. In this Chaitime show, we talk to Dr. Swati Daithankar, an accomplished internationally acclaimed Bharatanatyam dancer, professor and performer. Along with her, we also have Smt.
