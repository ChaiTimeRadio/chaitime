								<h2>In conversation with NAATAK team about their upcoming drama: Rabbit Hole</h2>
								<p>In this show,  we talk to Harish Sunderam Agastya, Kamala Subramanium and Geeta Rai about NAATAK’s upcoming production Rabbit Hole.  The play will be performed at the Cubberley Theater, Palo Alto from June 13-20, 2015. More information about the play, showtimes, and tickets can be found at: http://naatak.com/portfolio/rabbit-hole-2015/.<br/><br/> 

								Winner of the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, Rabbit Hole by David Lindsay-Abaire is a play about a family’s attempts to come to terms with a tragic loss. Set at a time well after the bereavement, the play examines the lives of 5 people directly impacted by it, as they try to relive their past and reconstruct their future. Rabbit Hole is an unsentimental, witty and improbably funny exploration of grief and is widely regarded as one of the best scripts in this genre. It was also made into a film starring Nicole Kidman, who received nominations for an Oscar and a Golden Globe.<br/><br/> 

								Harish Sunderam Agastya has been with Naatak since its inception in 1995. Rabbit Hole will be his 9th directorial venture with Naatak after Where There’s A Will (2003), Sleuth (2007), Final Solutions (2008), Aath Ghante (2011), Mowgli and I (2012), Disconnect (2014) and the staged readings of Hayavadana (2015) and A Wife of Buddha (2015).  He is on Naatak’s board and serves as its Head of Operations.<br/><br/> 

								Kamala Subramaniam’s previous theatre experiences in an actor/director role have been with Mahesh Dattani’s theatre group Playpen (Macbeth, The Owl and the Pussycat), North Carolina Professional Theater (Blood Relations, The Private Ear and the Public Eye, Seussical the Musical, The Vagina Monologues), Bay Area Drama Company (Izzat Bai in Bhopal), and Naatak (Patol Babu Filmstar, Punishment). Additionally, she has donned several production hats for Naatak since 2006. She indulges her passion for theater when she is not busy juggling work and kids.<br/><br/>  

								Geeta Rai made her Bay Area debut as Purnima in Enacte Art’s  Go To Your Room, Mother. Trained  in the Trinity School of London Speech and Drama Curriculum,  her love for theater was harnessed by Pune’s renowned teacher, Phiroza Bharucha. She continues sharpening the saw at the Foothill College Theater Program. She is thrilled to be in her first Naatak play, a rite of passage for any Bay Area theater artist.</p>
